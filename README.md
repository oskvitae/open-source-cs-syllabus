# open-source-cs-syllabus
A Computer Science syllabus I’m developing to teach myself key concepts. I’ll share notes and insights that may help fellow self-learners—offering perspectives seasoned pros might overlook. :)

Prerequisite considerations
- Classical Mechanics ( Physics Concepts )
- Single Variable Calculus
- Multiple Variable Calculus
- Boolean Algerba & Logic


Introduction to Computer Science
- Short History of Computing
- What is Computer Science?
- What is Abstraction in Computer Science?


Computer Architecture & Low-Level Thinking Foundations
- How Computers Work: Hardware vs. Software
- Binary & Number Representation
- Memory Management & the Stack/Heap


Fundamentals of Programming
- What is Programming
- Data Types
- Variables
- Control Flows
- Functions & Modular Code


High-level Programming ( I am choosing Python - one can pick more relevant for long-term use cases )
- What is a high-level programming language?
- Object Oriented 


Data Structures & Algorithms (Core Foundations)
- Arrays & Lists – Contiguous memory, indexing, operations
- Tuples & Immutable Structures
- Sets & Hash Tables (Dictionaries/Hashes) – Hashing, lookups, collisions
- Stacks & Queues – LIFO/FIFO, practical applications
- Linked Lists – Singly & doubly linked
- Searching & Sorting Algorithms – Binary search, quicksort, mergesort
- Big O Notation & Algorithmic Complexity
